MedianScore is a simple C# console app used to perform the assigned task. It uses two lists of integers for keeping information about current scores and cumulative median scores. 

The algorithm in pseudocode:

	While number of correct inputs <= input limit
		Read user input and check corner cases until input is correct*
		Add the input value to scores_list and print the new scores_list
		Determine the median score for current scores_list**
		Print new median_scores_list
	end While

*Correct input is stated in the task description.

**MedianScores function pseudocode:
	Sort the scores_list
	index -> scores_list length / 2
	If scores_list length is even
		median -> ceiling of ((scores_list[index-1] + scores_list[index]) / 2)
	else
		median -> scores_list[index]
	Add new median score to median_scores_list


PrintScores function is used to print a list of integers in this format:
[100, 20, 50, 70, 45]
